# OpenSource  Analysis of Economic Convergence Clubs for Croatia

The paper analyzes the income convergence of Croatia in the period from 2000 to 2024 according to four groups of countries: EU15, NMS8, NMS12 and SE4. The analysis uses the methodology of time series, that is, fractional integration in the empirical specification of the income convergence model. The results confirm the existence of convergence between Croatia and EU15 countries and Croatia and SE4 countries, while convergence towards new member countries has not been confirmed. In addition, the results strongly confirm that Croatia belongs to the convergence club of southern European countries, weakly confirm its membership in the EU15 club and indicate that it does not belong to the convergence club of new European member states.
